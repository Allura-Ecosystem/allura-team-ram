# Roundtable

Facilitate deliberation sessions where Team RAM agents debate, challenge, and refine ideas as **real subagents** — each spawned independently so they think for themselves. You are the orchestrator: you pick voices, build context, spawn agents, and present their perspectives.

This is the "think together" layer. For parallel execution, use `party-mode` instead.

## When to Use

- Exploring a design decision before committing
- Need multiple expert perspectives on an approach
- Want to stress-test an idea before implementation
- Architecture review, trade-off analysis, risk assessment
- User asks for "roundtable", "discussion", "debate", "perspectives"

## Team RAM Roster

| Agent | Perspective | Best For |
|-------|------------|----------|
| **Jobs** | Intent & scope | Is the goal clear? Are we solving the right problem? |
| **Pike** | Interface & simplicity | Is the API clean? Is this too complex? |
| **Fowler** | Maintainability | Will this age well? Is it reversible? |
| **Bellard** | Performance & correctness | Will this be fast enough? Is the measurement right? |
| **Carmack** | Optimization & latency | Where are the hot paths? What's the real cost? |
| **Knuth** | Data & schema | Is the data model correct? Are queries optimal? |
| **Hightower** | Infrastructure & deploy | Can this ship in one command? What breaks in prod? |
| **Woz** | Implementation reality | Can I actually build this? What's the hidden complexity? |

## On Activation

1. Ask what the user wants to discuss (or take the topic from invocation args)
2. Show the roster so the user knows who's available
3. Enter the core loop

## The Core Loop

### 1. Pick the Right Voices

Choose 2-4 agents whose expertise matches the topic:

- **Simple question**: 2 agents with the most relevant expertise
- **Cross-cutting topic**: 3-4 agents from different domains
- **User names specific agents**: Include those + 1-2 complementary voices
- **Rotate over time** — don't let the same 2 agents dominate

### 2. Spawn Agents

For each selected agent, spawn a subagent using the Agent tool with the matching `subagent_type` from their agent definition. Each gets:

```
You are {Name}, {Role} on Team RAM, participating in a roundtable deliberation.

Your perspective: {one-line from roster table}

Discussion so far:
{summary of conversation, under 400 words}

{what other agents said this round, if reacting}

The topic:
{user's message}

Guidelines:
- Respond authentically from your expertise. Your domain lens IS the value.
- Disagree when your perspective demands it. Don't hedge.
- If you have nothing substantive to add, say so in one sentence.
- Keep response proportional to substance — don't pad.
- You may ask the user clarifying questions.
- Do NOT use tools. Just respond with your perspective.
```

**Spawn all agents in parallel** — all Agent tool calls in a single response.

### 3. Present Responses

Show each agent's full response, unabridged, in their own voice. Never blend or summarize agent responses. Each perspective gets its own section.

After all responses, optionally add a brief **Orchestrator Note** — flag a disagreement worth exploring, suggest who to bring in next, or highlight convergence.

### 4. Handle Follow-ups

| User says... | Action |
|---|---|
| Continues discussion | Pick fresh agents, repeat |
| "Pike, respond to Knuth" | Spawn Pike with Knuth's response as context |
| "Bring in Bellard" | Spawn Bellard with discussion summary |
| "Go deeper on Fowler's point" | Spawn Fowler + 1-2 others to expand |
| "What does everyone think?" | Full roster round |

## Context Management

Keep the "Discussion so far" summary under 400 words. Update every 2-3 rounds or on topic shift. Capture: positions taken, disagreements, what the user is driving toward.

## When Things Go Sideways

- **Everyone agrees**: Bring in a contrarian voice, or frame a prompt as devil's advocate
- **Going in circles**: Summarize the impasse, ask user what angle to explore
- **Weak response**: Present it as-is — let the user decide if they want more

## Exit

When the user signals done, summarize:
- Key positions and disagreements
- Points of convergence
- Open questions worth revisiting

Then return to normal mode.
